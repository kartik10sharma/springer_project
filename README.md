# üíº Employee Sentiment Analysis üìä

This project performs sentiment analysis on internal employee communications to measure engagement, rank employees, and identify potential flight risks. It uses NLP techniques and linear regression to derive insights from email message data.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset (`test.csv`) includes the following fields:
- `subject`: Subject of the email
- `body`: Email message body
- `date`: Date of the message
- `from`: Sender's email address

The dataset is unlabeled, so the first step involves automatic sentiment labeling using TextBlob.

---

## üß† Project Objectives

1. **Sentiment Labeling**: Automatically tag messages as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using TextBlob.
2. **EDA**: Analyze sentiment distribution and monthly trends using visualizations.
3. **Employee Scoring**: Assign sentiment scores (+1, 0, -1) and compute monthly sentiment score per employee.
4. **Ranking**: Identify top 3 most and least positive employees per month.
5. **Flight Risk Detection**: Flag employees who sent 4+ negative messages within any rolling 30-day window.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Use linear regression to predict sentiment scores based on message features.

## ‚úÖ Results Summary

- **Top Positive Employees**: Based on cumulative monthly sentiment scores.
- **Top Negative Employees**: Based on lowest monthly sentiment scores.
- **Flight Risks**: Employees sending 4+ negative emails in any 30-day period.
- **Regression Model**:
  - üìâ MSE: 3.6416377693387716
  - üìä R¬≤ Score: 0.4221135463491611

## üìå Future Improvements

- Replace TextBlob with transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for better sentiment accuracy.
- Build a dashboard for live monitoring.
- Include receiver metadata and thread replies for richer context.
